<p>The PhotoCompass application architecture follows the guidelines of the Android Developer Guide ({@link http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals.html}).
It loosely resembles a MVC structure where the Activities are the Controllers. Additionally the application has service components, that run
autonomously and are loosely coupled to the activities.</p>
